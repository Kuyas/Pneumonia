# Pneumonia

Pneumonia is an infection that affects the lungs of more than 450 million people in today’s world and has led to at least a million deaths every year. It causes inflammation of the lung principally affecting the alveoli which are the small sacs where the gas exchange takes place. Diagnosis of Pneumonia is done usually done via chest x-rays and/or a physical exam. A chest x-ray or a radiograph is the primary method for its diagnosis. This project aims to alleviate the stress on doctors by detecting pneumonia through radiographs so that the diagnosis and treatment can move faster. We use Neural Networks to classify a chest x-ray into two classes Normal and Pneumonia and try to improve the network model for better accuracy.
